## Introduction
TradeOracle is an advanced machine learning model designed to predict the outcomes of long options flow signal trading strategies. Leveraging historical trade data from the BlackBoxStocks team trader Maria Chaudhry, it provides traders with actionable insights to enhance their decision-making process.

## Features
- **Predictive Analysis**: Utilize historical trading data to predict the success of future trades.
- **Customizable Model**: Tailored features and parameters to fit specific trading strategies.
- **Automated Data Processing**: Integrated tools for efficient data handling and feature generation.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-Learn, and other relevant Python libraries.
- Access to historical options trading data.

## Installation and Setup
1. Clone the repository: `git clone [repository_url]`
2. Install required Python packages: `pip install -r requirements.txt`

## Usage
To use TradeOracle, follow these steps:
1. Prepare your data using `DataDownloader.py`.
2. Process the data with `DataProcessor.py`.
